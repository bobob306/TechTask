/*
This class handles the state of view data
A view model will set a view data as loading when it is being modified, for example added to
by a network request

When the modification is completed the data will move to the data type with a content or error if
there was some problem particularly with a network request and there is no cached data.

A bit like the Result class for network requests in a way, just a wrapper to make things a bit more
reliable and handle errors a bit more comfortably.
